### v0.2.1

- Removed the old labeling feature. It's no longer necessary since my PR to the core codebase was merged and released in v11 build 306!
- All features now default to off. I wasn't expecting anyone to actually use this module and made some short-sighted decisions by letting them start enabled.
- Added a changelog (you're reading it!)
